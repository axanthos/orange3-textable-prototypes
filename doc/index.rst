Orange Textable Prototypes documentation
========================================

Welcome to the documentation of Orange3 Textable Prototypes.

Orange3 Textable Prototypes is an open-source add-on for Orange Canvas 3. It
collects text-analytic widgets that couldn't be included in the core 
Textable distribution for various reasons (notably because they introduce
dependencies to third-party packages, or simply because they're not yet
production-ready), but that may still be found useful by Orange 
Canvas/Textable users.

The project is brought to the community by the `department of language and
information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ at the `University of
Lausanne <http://www.unil.ch>`_. It is hosted at 
`<https://github.com/axanthos/orange3-textable-prototypes>`_, and the 
documentation can be found at 
`<http://orange3-textable-prototypes.readthedocs.org/>`_.
