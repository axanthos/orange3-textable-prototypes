    Figure 1: **Poetica** widget interface.

The **Poetica** widget allows the user to make a research on the Poetica's website (`<https://poetica.fr/>`_).

The **Select criterias** section allows the user to search poems by their author and/or topic.
He can add his favorite results to his basket.

* ``Author``

    List of authors from which the selection can be made.

* ``Topic``

    List of topics from which the selection can be made.

* ``Search``

    If an author and/or a topic has been selected, allow the research.

* ``Refresh database``

    Update the database of urls, titles, authors and topics of the poems.
    This action may take some time. This is why a pop-up asks the user to confirm the update when the button has been clicked.

* ``Add to corpus``

    Add one ore more selected poems in the user's basket.

* ``Clear results``

    Clear the research results basket.


The **Corpus** section is the user's basket. There he can remove elements from his corpus or clear it completely.

* ``Remove from corpus``

    Remove one or more selected items from the user's basket.

* ``Clear corpus``

    Delete the whole user's basket

The **Send** button manages the emission of a segmentation to the output
connection(s). When selected, the **Send automatically** checkbox
disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically emit a
segmentation at every modification of its interface.
