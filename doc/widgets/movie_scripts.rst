Figure 1: **Movie Scripts** widget interface

The **Movie Scripts** widget simply lets the user make a search on the `SpringfieldSpringfield <https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/>`_ website.

The **Search** button searches the database for entries matching user's input.

The **Refresh Database** button downloads the newest collection of all the movie titles available on the website and stores them in cache. 

The **Corpus** section is a container where the User's Scripts are stored. The User can add or remove scripts to and from their corpus or clear the corpus entirely.

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the output connection(s). When selected, the Send automatically checkbox disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically emit a segmentation at every modification of its interface.
