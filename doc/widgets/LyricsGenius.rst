    :alt: Interface of the LyricsGenius widget

    Figure 1: **LyricsGenius** widget interface.

The **LyricsGenius** widget simply lets the user make a search on the
`Genius <https://genius.com/>`_ website.

The **Create my corpus** section allows the user to add or remove songs from
the search results.

The **My titles** section is the user "Corb". He can add or remove songs form
his corpus with the section **Create my corpus**.

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the output
connection(s). When selected, the **Send automatically** checkbox
disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically emit a
segmentation at every modification of its interface.

Warnings
~~~~~~~~

*Settings were changed, please click 'Send' when ready.*
    Settings have changed but the **Send automatically** checkbox

    button (or equivalently check the box) in order for computation and data
    emission to proceed.

*You didn't search anything*
    The user want to make a search with no text in the query box.

*Your corpus is empty, please add some songs first*
    The corpus is empty, so the user have to add some songs before sending.

*Couldn't download data from Genius website.*
    An error has prevented the widget to download the data from the
    Genius website (most likely related to a connection problem).
