Figure 1: **Movie Reviews** widget interface

The **Movie Reviews** widget lets the user make a search on the IMDB library.

The **Search** button searches the database for entries matching user's input.

The **Corpus** section is a container where the user's movie selections are stored. The user can add or remove the movies to and from their corpus or clear the corpus entirely.

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a segmentation to the output connection(s). When selected, the Send automatically checkbox disables the button and the widget attempts to automatically emit a segmentation at every modification of its interface.
